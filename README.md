This repo contains source files for my [personal blog](https://anantd.github.io).

The site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), with a modified version of [this theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-even/). Comments are powered by [utteranc.es](https://utteranc.es/).

Theme modifications include:

- [x] CSS updates (fonts, link behavior)
- [x] Changes to homepage layout, adding content before 'Recent posts'
- [x] Support for [littlefoot.js](https://github.com/goblindegook/littlefoot)

To do:

- [ ] Add elements of [Tufte CSS](https://alanorth.github.io/hugo-theme-tufte-css/2017/02/tufte-css-is-for-lovers/), particularly support for side notes
