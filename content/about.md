I'm a data scientist interested in creating intuitive explanations. I write code, mostly in Python, R, and SQL. You can [see my portfolio here](https://www.notion.so/anantd/Work-7d31c8cb819c4a61a32a1f1bc8f5846c), and [reach me via email](mailto:anant.dalela@gmail.com?subject=Hi!) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/4nant).

This blog is an evolving exercise in developing a regular writing habit, being a more deliberate consumer of the things I read, and creating useful artifacts along the way. 

Here's how it's set up at the moment:  

[**Posts**](/post/) -- *moderately-polished essays*  
[**Notes**](/note) -- *semi-polished notes-to-self, links, clips, and recommendations. The goal is to produce these at a fairly rapid clip, then gradually build more detailed notes (eventually something resembling essays).*
  
Over time, this page will turn into "where to start" page. For now, thanks for checking it out! Drop me a line if you have any feedback.
